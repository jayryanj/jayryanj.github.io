Have you ever thought about going to the beach, but you weren't sure if the conditions were right?

During my free time, I developed a small program called <em>Hawaii Beach Conditions</em>. The program simply allows the user to select various beaches on Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the Big Island to see its current conditions. The user may select any of the provided islands, choose a beach, then a table will be shown displaying information about the beach using the Hawaii Beach Safety API[http://hawaiibeachsafety.com/rest/conditions.json]

Some of the information include the beach's name, island, weather, wind , temperature, and surf.
