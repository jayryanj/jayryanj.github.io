LAN-Scan-js is a web browser tool that allows users to run a basic host-discovery scan against their LAN. 

The purpose of the tool is provide a basic, simple tool for scanning your network for connected devices. It avoids the need to write your own script in the command-line or use a more complex tool like nmap. The main functionality of LAN-Scan-js is entirely written in JavaScript using Node.js. It uses ICMP Echo to contact devices, and it works in Windows and Linux platforms. This project is meant to be run locally, so there is no deployed site. DO NOT use this on the public Internet.
