DCIM@Hawaii is a web app designed to assist the management and organization of data center devices such as routers, servers, switches, and other devices used in IT infrastructure. 

The project was developed using React and Semantic-UI for front-end and Express.js for back-end. User and device data is stored using MongoDB.

Note: Due to DCIM@Hawaii primarily being a proprietary tool for the data center department at the University of Hawaii, development has ceased since my transfer to a different department.
