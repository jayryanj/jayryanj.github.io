Software engineering isn't just about writing in a single language like many early coders believe when they begin college or a coding boot camp. Some of us might remember writing our very first <em>hello world</em> program in Java and naively thinking that creating programs was a simple process. However, we've all eventually realized that most applications are not that black-and-white. There are many principles and technologies such as agile project management and user-interface frameworks that are stacked together to create functional and convenient software for users. 

<h2>It All Works Together</h2>
Software--especially web applications--depend on many different technologies that need to work together. Creating a website requires more than just some markup on the browser page. They often require frameworks, third-party libraries, multiple languages, a database, and many other components that need to talk to each other to form a functional website. They all contribute towards the goal of presenting a workable application to users. A technology stack is an unfamiliar concept to those that are still in the early stages of programming. However, it's a crucial aspect of software engineering that all coders should familiarize themselves with in order to create effective web applications. Without a user-interface framework such as Semantic-UI or Bootstrap, an application may often fail to properly display on mobile devices. Without a database, an application wouldn't be able to effectively store and retrieve data. All these components need to pull their weight in the project and
