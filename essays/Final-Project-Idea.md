# Problem
Commuting to UH Manoa is always a pain. The traffic is bad, the buses are slow, and the parking isn't always available. If I wanted to look at all the parking lots on campus and their policies, I would be directed to <a href="https://manoa.hawaii.edu/commuter/maps.html">this webpage</a> of maps. The maps are very hard to read, and the policies aren't very clear. It takes too much time to figure out where to park from the information on those PDFs. After going through that process, it's not even a guarantee that we'd get a parking spot in any of those lots. The general experience of a user that's just trying to figure out where to park and the cost of parkin there is just too inconvenient.

# Idea
To solve the parking information issue, what if we had an application that displays this information with an easy-to-understand interface. It would provide an interactive map that provides filters to easily display the candidate parking lots. There will be no need to look at a PDF file and manually zoom in to the confusing map. The interactive map will be easy to use as Google Maps. Furthermore, there is a lot of unnecessary information on the maps depending on your situation (whether you're a student, faculty, visitor, dorm resident, etc.). The map would gray out any parking lots that are not available for your current search. Furthermore, the parking policies change throughout the day. The application would update these policies, so the user can have real-time information on the parking policies and rates. For customization, you can add a "favorite" parking lot that you may prefer. The app would display whether it's available or not (conceptually). Also, the user can input their class location and the app could suggest parking lots or stalls that are close but still eligible.
