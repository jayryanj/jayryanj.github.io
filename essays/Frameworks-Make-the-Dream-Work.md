The world of web development is brighter with frameworks. Creating websites with pure HTML and CSS has been one of the most toxic experiences. Creating a full-fledged website was often difficult, problematic, and ugly. When I discovered frameworks, it seemed like my web development life had taken a turn for the best. User-interface frameworks are very useful tools that allow software engineers quickly create consistent code that is understandable, arguably more readable, and extendible in comparison to using pure HTML and CSS.

# Consistency is Key
First of all, UI frameworks allows us to create consistent code with similar properties and aesthetics. When I create web pages in pure HTML and CSS, the source code is often extremely inconsistent. I often realize that most of the code has redundant class and ID attributes. Using Semantic-UI and other frameworks allows software engineers to create pages that are consistent and logically grouped in an efficiently written way. If I wanted to create several "tiny" elements, I don't need to manually manage the size of all the different elements that I consider tiny. UI frameworks allows me to reuse code to build consistent pages.
