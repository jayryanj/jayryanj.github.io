JavaScript is one of those bosses in a video game that I've encountered in the past, got beaten badly, then decided to go through the rest of the game avoiding. I had prior experience with the language when I had first learned about web development in my early high school years. However, learning JavaScript back then was a sour experience for me that had stuck for many years until the Fall semester of 2019. After being reintroduced to JavaScript in my software engineering course, my perspective on the language has positively changed.

I never used to think that design and technology went hand in hand.  Thus, learning about software engineering and the role of design has been incredibly interesting to me. Design, implementation, and management are just some of the many things I wish to learn more about. Good art, in a way, makes a person question it. They become joined in the idea of visualization – where captivation meets inspiration.

I am now starting to take a Software Engineering class. I hope to learn a lot through the course, but I know it will be just the beginning of my journey. By the time I’m done with it, I hope I’ve learned enough to take the next step in my life as a developer. But until then, my fire will keep on burning.
